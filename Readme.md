Step 1: Load and Prepare the Data

First, i need to load GPS event log data into a pandas DataFrame.  from the CSV file format.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

I Checked and clean data if needed. This may include handling missing values, data type conversions,
and renaming columns.

Step:3 Synthetic Data Generation

I have generated synthetic data using Faker library to create more data points for analysis, it 
generates synthetic data and appends it to the original dataset.

Step 4: Basic Statistics and Visualization

I have started with basic statistics and visualizations to get an overview of the data

Step 5: User Behavior Analysis

Analyze user behavior by examining the distribution of event counts per user, 
This will help you understand how many events each user has generated, giving insights into user behavior

Step 6: Anomaly Detection

We can use machine learning techniques for anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns in the data.
For example, here i am using isolation forests or from the scikit-learn library, 
This will help you detect anomalous users based on their event counts

Step 7: Location-Based Insights:

Explanation: Location-based insights focus on the geographical aspects of the delivery service. we can
cluster locations to identify areas with high user activity, pinpoint delivery hotspots, or track routes 
taken by delivery personnel. By calculating distances between consecutive events, we can gain insights into 
the efficiency of delivery routes. This analysis also helps us identify frequent locations and better 
understand user behavior at specific geographic points.
I use a library called folium and pointed the locations using longitude and latitude given in the data.
